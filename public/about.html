<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a web developer who loves turning ideas into clean, functional experiences. Right now I’m honing my skills at IIT
  Patna, where I tackle real‑world problems head‑on—whether that’s building a mini‑CRM from scratch or whipping up a
  sleek landing page for a campus event. I focus on practical solutions that actually get used, not just shiny demos
  that gather dust.

</p>

<p>My toolkit is pretty straightforward: HTML, CSS and JavaScript form the backbone, React and Next.js keep things
  dynamic, and I round it out with Node.js and MongoDB on the backend. I believe in writing code that’s easy to read,
  maintain and scale—no cryptic one‑liners you need a decoder ring to understand. Clean commits, documented APIs and a
  habit of testing everything make sure my projects stay solid as they grow.</p>

<p>Outside of code, I’m all about staying disciplined and leveling up every single day. Whether that means pushing my
  limits in the gym or grinding through a new library until I own it, I treat every challenge like a quest. If you want
  a developer who communicates plainly, moves fast, and won’t stop until the job’s done right, let’s build something
  awesome together</p>
